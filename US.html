    <center><p>The threat of a government shutdown has become a common event in Washington.

        More than 2 million civilians are employed by the U.S. government, and while a shutdown is of special concern to the many federal employees in the District of Columbia and its surrounding areas, these workers have a presence in every state in the union.

And some Southern states are federal employee hubs.</p></center>
